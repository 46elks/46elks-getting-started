## Challenges

### Stay calm and keep coding
Feel free to continue working on what you've already started if you have a good flow going and you're learning new things.

### Examday phonecall & prep!
Make your phone ring in the morning of your next day of exam, to wake you up and send a text to yourself with the address and room number.
1. Record yourself saying "You can do it!" 
2. Schedule a phone call to your self on a specific date. 
3. Play "You can do it!" when you answer. :]
4. Send a text to yourself with details on where it is and a reminder to bring your ID*.

### One magic number to rule them all!
Get creative with phone numbers. Imagine you're a team in an organization and all things dull and repetitive, you want to automate as far as possible. Allow people to call in sick, to text in changes for an upcoming event. Collect feedback at the end of a workshop through your number and collect replies neetly structured into a google spreadsheet. 

### Surprize us! 
Create something useful or playful where you integrate one or more apis in to your creation.
