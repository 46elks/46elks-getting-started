# WebRTC

WebRTC stands for ‚ÄùWeb Real-Time Communication‚Äù and enables communication between browsers over audio, video and text.

In this example we have built a communication stream between a browser and a *regular phone*. Currently there are two things you can do with this code:

- Call from your browser to a regular phone
- Receive calls in you browser made from a regular phone

## Getting started
1. Create an [account](https://46elks.com/register) at 46elks.
2. Get a [virtual number](https://46elks.com/guides/get-virtual-number).
3. Get a WebRTC-number. Ask our [support](https://46elks.com/support) to add one for you.
4. [Configure voice_start](https://46elks.com/guides/configure-voice-start) on your virtual number. Set `{"connect" : "<your_webrtc_number>"}`.

## Add your credentials

1. Add your [API credentials](https://46elks.com/account) in `forward.php`
```
$username = "API_USERNAME";
$password = "API_PASSWORD";
```

2. Add your [WebRTC credentials](https://46elks.com/guides/find-webrtc-credentials) in `script.js`
```
var inoutnumber  	= 'YOUR_VIRTUAL_NUMBER';
var webrtcUser 		= 'WEBRTC_USER';
var webrtcPass 		= 'WEBRTC_PASS'; 
```


## Try it out

1. Make a call to your virtual number from your phone and the call will appear in your browser.
2. Make a call to your regular phone from your browser and your phone will start ringing.
3. Don't forget that you can style your new ‚Äùweb phone‚Äù in any way that you want.

Have fun! ü•≥
